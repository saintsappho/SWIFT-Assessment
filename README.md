# The Assignment:

## SWIFT Frontend Assessment
The following project folder has a simple frontend page to start your project. You are tasked with the following using Vue:
<ul>
<li> This frontend is intended for a user to be able to upload a document and render a preview of that document. First convert the app.txt to app.js.
Every time a document is uploaded we want to add that document to this list of documents in the unordered list in the section with id="user-docs". <br>

If the user has not uploaded any documents, display using conditional rendering the paragraph in the paragraph tag under the user-docs section. Feel free to change this description if desired. For this task we recommend you reference the Vue documentation for conditional rendering: https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html this allows you to render conditional elements in the DOM. </li>

<li>Once this functionality is complete, add some styling and design to enhance the user experience, and one other feature such as converting the list of uploaded documents to a component with other information from the doc. A clear button that clears the list. Anything. Just keep in mind the law of diminishing margins! Timeliness and functionality are often most important to clients. Good luck!  </li>
</ul> 

## How it Went
Implementing the frontend for document uploading and previewing was an engaging challenge. I successfully converted the provided app.txt to app.js, I started from scratch with Vue functionality for dynamic updates. However, I encountered an issue with clearing the list of documents upon user action.

Despite implementing the functionality to clear the list, it seems there's a hiccup in the code preventing it from functioning as intended. 

<ul>
<li>
1.5 hours of learning and solo-debugging could not yet solve this problem. I'm excited to dive deeper into debugging to identify and resolve the issue after discussing the specific needs of the clients.
</li>
<li>
I worked on improving the user experience through styling and added a feature to convert the list of uploaded documents into a more informative component. 
I tried to ensure a balance between functionality and aesthetics without spending too much time in CSS beautification, as I worked to follow the law of diminishing margins.
</li>
</ul>
In summary, while I encountered a challenge with clearing the list of documents, I'm committed to resolving it swiftly. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress made and look forward to refining the functionality to meet the project requirements seamlessly.
