# SWIFT Frontend Assessment
The following project folder has a simple frontend page to start your project. You are tasked with the following using Vue:
<ul>
<li> This frontend is intended for a user to be able to upload a document and render a preview of that document. First convert the app.txt to app.js.
Every time a document is uploaded we want to add that document to this list of documents in the unordered list in the section with id="user-docs". <br>

If the user has not uploaded any documents, display using conditional rendering the paragraph in the paragraph tag under the user-docs section. Feel free to change this description if desired. For this task we recommend you reference the Vue documentation for conditional rendering: https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html this allows you to render conditional elements in the DOM. </li>

<li>Once this functionality is complete, add some styling and design to enhance the user experience, and one other feature such as converting the list of uploaded documents to a component with other information from the doc. A clear button that clears the list. Anything. Just keep in mind the law of diminishing margins! Timeliness and functionality are often most important to clients. Good luck!  </li>
</ul>
